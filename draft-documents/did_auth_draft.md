# Abstract

The term DID Auth has been used in different ways and is currently not well-defined. We define DID Auth as a ceremony where an _identity owner_, with the help of various components such as web browsers, mobile devices, and other agents, proves to a _relying party_ that they are in control of a DID. This means demonstrating control over the DID using the mechanism specified in the DID Document's "authentication" object. This could take place using a number of different data formats, protocols, and flows. DID Auth includes the ability to establish mutually authenticated communication channels, and to authenticate to web sites and applications. Authorization, Verifiable Credentials, and Capabilities are built on top of DID Auth and out of scope for this document. This paper gives on overview of the scope of DID Auth, supported protocols and flows, the use of components of the DID Documents which are relevant to authentication, as well as formats for challenges and responses.


# Definitions

**TODO:** Review this a bit more.

**Authentication**: The ceremony where an identity owner proves to a _relying party_ that the _identity owner_ controls a DID, by a mechanism that is described in the DID's associated DID Document.

**Authorization**: Method of verifying the rights and privileges of an individual to perform certain actions upon a DID that is not proving its ownership.

**Decentralized Identifier (DID)**: A globally unique identifier that does not require a centralized registration authority because it is registered with distributed ledger technology or other form of decentralized network. (see [here](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#terminology))

**DID Document**: A set of data that describes a DID, including mechanisms, such as public keys and pseudonymous biometrics, that an entity can use to authenticate itself as the DID. A DID Document may also contain other attributes or claims describing the entity. (see [here](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#terminology))

**DID Record**: The combination of a DID and its associated DID Document.

**Identity owner**: Individual, organization or thing who has rights and privileges to perform certain actions upon a DID.

**Identity subject**: Individual, organization or thing whom a DID identifies.

**Relying party**: Individual, organization or thing that authenticates an Identity Owner using the DID Auth protocol. Also called "Verifier" in other specifications.

**Verifiable Credentials**: A set of one or more claims which are statements made by an issuer about a subject that is tamper-resistant and whose authorship can be cryptographically verified (see [here](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#terminology)).


# Introduction

## Scope

DID Auth defines data formats and challenge and response transports allowing an _identity owner_ to prove control over a DID to a _relying party_. A successful DID Auth interaction may create the required conditions to allow the parties to exchange further data in a trustworthy way. This further data could include streams of raw data from sensors to the exchange of Verifiable Credentials. This further exchange of data is out of scope of the DID Auth exchange and specification.

Proof of control over a DID is a technical action which may be a precursor to establishing a trustworthy relationship between two parties. The DID Auth interaction may be a one way interaction where A proves control over a DID<sub>A</sub> to B, or a two way interaction where mutual proof of control over DIDs is achieved. Two way control is a situation where A proves control over DID<sub>A</sub> to B and B proves control over DID<sub>B</sub> to A.

It is in the purview of the two parties engaged in the interaction to determine the need to have a one way or two way DID Auth interaction. It is also in the purview of the two parties to determine if further exchanges of data may be necessary to establish the nature of the relationship between the two parties.

Implementers may decide to subsume a DID Auth interaction within a higher layer interaction such as the exchange of a Verifiable Credential which could simultaneously prove control over a DID and offer some other Verifiable Credentials for some specific transaction specific purpose.

## DID Auth and Verifiable Credentials

Even though DID Auth is about proving control over a DID, the exchange of Verifiable Credentials associated with a DID is closely related to DID Auth. There are three approaches how DID Auth and Verifiable Credentials can work together:

1. **DID Auth and Verifiable Claims exchange are separate:** At the beginning of an interaction between two parties, they need to authenticate (mutually, or just in one direction). Then after this is done, a protocol for Verifiable Credentials exchange can be executed, so that the two parties can learn more about each other (and then perhaps make authorization decisions).

2. **Verifiable Credentials exchange is an extension to DID Auth:** In this approach, proving control of an identifier, and proving possession of Verifiable Credentials are closely related, and a single protocols is used for both purposes. The Verifiable Credentials are an "optional field" in the protocol. In order to "only" prove control of an identifier, then the Verifiable Credentials that are exchanged are an empty list.

3. **DID Auth is a certain kind of Verifiable Credential:** It is possible to think of DID Auth as an exchange of the most trivial Verifiable Credential imaginable. A self-issued Verifiable Credential that states "I am me". From this perspective, the separation between DID Auth and exchange of "other" Verifiable Credentials is very vague, and both are part of the same protocol.

## DID Record Creation

DID Auth requires authentication material that is generated during DID Record Creation. As stated in the DID Spec, the steps to create a DID Record compliant with DID Auth are:

1.  Generate a NEW_DID as specified in the relevant DID Method Specification.
1.  Generate a NEW_DID_DOCUMENT as specified in the relevant DID Method Specification.
    1.  The id property must have the value of NEW_DID.
1.  Choose one or more authentication type(s) from the array of proof mechanisms.
    1.  Record the type property in an `authentication` object of the NEW_DID_DOCUMENT.
1.  Generate authentication material for use at a later time during Authentication of a DID. The authentication type determines how to generate authentication material for a proof mechanism.
1.  Communicate and store the authentication material, either directly or as derived material, in the NEW_DID_DOCUMENT and for storage by the Identity Owner. If the chosen proof mechanism is based on asymmetric keys, the authentication material in the NEW_DID_DOCUMENT is recorded in a `publicKey` object in the DID Document.

Example `authentication` and `publicKey` objects in a DID Document:

```
{
	"@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
	"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
	"authentication": [{
		"type": "RsaSignatureAuthentication2018",
		"publicKey": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1"
	}, {
		"type": "Ed25519SignatureAuthentication2018",
		"publicKey": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2"
	}],
	"publicKey": [{
		"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
		"type": "RsaVerificationKey2018",
		"owner": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
		"publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\r\n"
	}, {
		"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
		"type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
		"owner": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
		"publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
	}]
}
```

DID Auth can use different transports for exchanging challenges and responses between an _identity owner_ and a _relying party_. One such transport uses an HTTP POST call to a DID Auth service endpoint. This service endpoint can be discovered from a DID Document.

Example DID Auth service endpoint in a DID Document:

```
{
	"@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
	"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
	"service": {
		"type": "DidAuthService",
		"serviceEndpoint": "https://auth.example.com/did:example:123456789abcdefg"
	}
}
```

## Authentication of a DID

This section describes a conceptual authentication framework of the DID Auth protocol. It relates general concepts of authentication to specific concepts of DID Auth.

**Authentication of a DID:** Similar to other authentication methods, DID Auth relies on a challenge-response cycle in which a _relying party_ authenticates the DID of an _identity owner_. During this cycle, an _identity owner_ demonstrates control of their authentication material that was generated and distributed during DID Record Creation through execution of the authentication proof mechanism.

**Challenge:** The way an identity owner or their agent encounters an auth challenge will vary on the context. For example, they can come across a 'Sign in with DID-Auth' button or a QR code. Or, in the context of an API call, the relying party may respond to a request by asking for authentication (the HTTP `401 Unauthorized` response is a classic example, although DID Auth covers many use cases beyond HTTP).

Challenge principles:

 * The _relying party_ may or may not know the _identity owner_'s DID at the time the challenge is constructed, and therefore the _identity owner_'s DID may or may not be included in the challenge.
 * If the DID is known at the time of challenge construction, then the relying party may use the contents of the DID Document to selec preferred authentication methods or service endpoints.
 * The challenge that is sent by the _relying party_ may or may not itself contain a proof of the _relying party_'s control of a DID.
 * The _relying party_ may or may not need additional transport-specific information about the _identity owner_ in order to be able to deliver the challenge (e.g. a DID Auth service endpoint). This additional protocol-specific information may be discoverable from the _identity owner's_ DID if it is known to the _relying party_.
* The _relying party_ should include a *nonce*, to prevent replay attacks and to help link the challenge to a subsequent response.

**Response:** Based on the challenge, the _identity owner_ then constructs a response that proves control of their DID. This often involves a cryptographic signature, but can include other proof mechanisms. (As mentioned earlier, the response may also contain some credentials or _identity owner_ attributes that the _relying party_ asked for in the challenge.) After receiving the response, the _relying party_ resolves the _identity owner_'s DID, and verifies that the response is valid for a prior challenge (for example, verifying the response signature based on a `publicKey` object contained in the DID Document).

Response principles:

 * The _identity owner_ may or may not need additional transport-specific information about the _relying party_ in order to be able to deliver the response (e.g. a callback URL). This additional protocol-specific information may be included in the challenge, or it may be discoverable from the _relying party_'s DID that is included in the challenge.
 * The _relying party_ must be able to internally link a response to a prior challenge. This can be done with a nonce or message identifier in the challenge that must also be included in the response. It can also be done by including the entire original challenge in the response.
 * Multiple devices, user agents, and other technical components may act on behalf of the _identity owner_ to receive and process the challenge. For example, an identity owner's DID Auth service endpoint may receive the challenge and relay it to the _identity owner_'s mobile app.
 * The _identity owner's_ component that sends the response may or may not be the same component as the one that received the challenge. E.g. the challenge may be received as HTTP POST by a **DID Auth service**, but the response may be sent as HTTP POST by a **mobile app** (see DID Auth Architecture 3).
 * The _relying party's_ component that receives the response may or may not be the same component as the one that sent the challenge. E.g. the challenge may be sent as deep link by a **mobile web page**, but the response may be received as HTTP POST by a **web server** (see DID Auth Architecture 2).

# Challenge Formats

In a DID Auth interaction, a challenge is transmitted by a _relying party_ to an _identity owner_, asking the _identity owner_ to return a response that proves their control of a DID. This section documents data formats for such challenges.

# Challenge Transports

A DID Auth challenge may be delivered by a _relying party_ to an _identity owner_ in different ways. DID Auth defines a few common ways this can be done.

## DID Auth service endpoint

If the _identity owner_'s DID is known to the _relying party_, it resolves it to its associated DID Document to find a DID Auth service endpoint and sends an HTTP POST with the challenge to that endpoint.

## Scan QR code from mobile app

The _relying party_ may display a DID Auth challenge encoded as a QR code, which is delivered to the _identity owner_ by scanning it with a DID Auth compatible mobile app.

## Mobile deep link

A mobile app or webpage may itself be a _relying party_ and deliver a DID Auth challenge to another mobile app that represents the _identity owner_.

Example:

```
did-auth:jwt/...
```

## Custom protocol handler

Similar to a mobile deep link, a web page can contain a web-based protocol link that contains a DID Auth challenge.

Example:

```
<a href="did-auth:jwt/...">Login with DID Auth</a>
```

## Invoke user agent's JavaScript API

A _relying party_ web site may deliver a DID Auth challenge to the _identity owner_ by invoking an API via a JavaScript function in the _identity owner_'s user agent.

Example: Browser Credential Handler API

```
	const credential = await navigator.credentials.get({
	  web: {
	    VerifiableProfile: {
	      name: true
	    }
	  }
	});
	console.log('credential received', credential);
```

 * https://credential-verifier.demo.digitalbazaar.com/

## Form redirect

A _relying party_ web site may deliver a DID Auth challenge to the _identity owner_ by redirecting to a DID Auth web site that acts on the _identity owner_'s behalf (similar to a classic IdP in OpenID Connect or SAML protocols).

Example:

```
	<form action="https://auth.example.com/did:example:123456789abcdefg" method="post">
		<input type="hidden" name="challenge" value="...">
		<input type="submit" value="Submit!">
	</form>
```

## Device-to-device communication

If both the _relying party_ and _identity owner_ meet physically with devices they control, the _relying party_ can deliver a DID Auth challenge to the _identity owner_ via direct communication between devices, using Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi, etc.


# Response Transports

## HTTP POST to callback URL

The DID Auth response may be delivered to the _relying party_ in the form of an HTTP POST to a callback URL. This callback URL may be known to the _identity owner_ in advance, it may have been included in the challenge, or it may be discoverable from the _relying party_'s DID.

## Scan QR code from mobile app

The _identity owner_ may encode a DID Auth response as a QR code, which is delivered to the _relying party_ by scanning it with a DID Auth compatible mobile app.

## Fulfill JavaScript promise

If the DID Auth challenge was delivered to the _identity owner_ via a JavaScript API, then the response may be returned to the _relying party_ via fulfillment of a JavaScript promise.


## Device-to-device communication

If both the _relying party_ and _identity owner_ meet physically with devices they control, the _identity owner_ can deliver a DID Auth response to the _relying party_ via direct communication between devices, using Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi, etc.


# Architectures

When selecting an appropriate architecture, it may be useful to keep in mind that the workflows below mainly differ along four dimensions.

1. Is the DID known to the relying party at the time of challenge construction
1. Transport mechanism of the challenge
1. The location of authentication material (i.e. where are the secrets stored?)
1. Transport mechanism of the response

Therefore, the following DID Auth architecture are only some examples of possible combinations of design options.

## DID Auth Architecture 1: Web page and mobile app

![DID Auth Diagram 1](./media/DID_Auth_Diagrams1.png)

 1. _Relying party's_ **web page** displays a QR code (with challenge) to _identity owner's_ **web browser**.
 1. { _Identity owner's_ **mobile app** scans QR code (with challenge) from _identity owner's **web browser**. }
 1. _Identity owner's_ **mobile app** sends HTTP POST (with response) to _relying party's_ **web server**.
 1. { _Relying party's_ **web server** is polled with HTTP GET (with response) by _relying party's_ **web page**. }

## DID Auth Architecture 8: DID-TLS

![DID Auth Diagram 8](./media/DID_Auth_Diagrams8.png)

 1. Two **services** (or agents, or hubs, etc.) act as both _identity owner_ and _relying party_ and engage in TLS handshake where mutual challenges and responses are exchanged and verified.

Note that while TLS specifications support mutual authentication handshakes, in practice some implementations are not well-suited for trust models that are not based on traditional certificate authorities..

Besides TLS, other protocols can also be used to establish secure channels with mutual authentication based on DIDs, such as CurveZMQ, or custom handshake protocols.

_Identity owner's_ **service (or agent, or hub, etc.)** sends an Auth-Encrypted Message to _relying party_'s **service (or agent, or hub, etc.)**. This message is then decrypted and authenticated by relying party_'s **service (or agent, or hub, etc.)** as a part of the decryption process.


# Relation to other Technologies

## Biometrics

Biometrics are recognizable and verifiable data, which are unique, specific to an _identity owner_, and available to every human being. Authentication with biometrics involves matching a non-reversible biometric template (or IBV - Initial Biometric Vector) against biometric input data (or CBV - Candidate Biometric Vector).

Biometrics can be used in several ways in conjunction with DID Auth:

 1. Biometrics such as fingerprints or voice can protect secret authentication material (such as a private key) on an _identity owner_'s physical device, which is used to construct a response to the _relying party_'s challenge. In this case, biometrics are only used locally to protect the _identity owner_'s part of the DID Auth challenge-response interaction; the proof mechanism listed in a DID Document does not directly involve biometrics.
 1. Biometric protocols such as [IEEE 2410-2015 "BOPS"](https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/2410-2017.html) or [Web Authentication](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) can be adapted to augment DID Auth flows by using biometrics in a standard way. In both protocols, no biometric data is exchanged between the _relying party_ and _identity owner_.
 1. Biometrics can also play a more direct role as a proof mechanism that is listed in a DID Document and used during a DID Auth challenge-response interaction to prove control over a DID. In this case, certain biometric data may be exchanged between a _relying party_ and an _identity owner_, and biometric service providers such as [iRespond](http://irespond.org/) can assist the process by offering to perform the biometric matching procedure via a remote service.

In any case, since biometrics are sensitive data with special properties (i.e. their semi-public nature and inability to revoke them), certain principles must be carefully followed, e.g.: No storage of biometrics in centralized silos, no storage of biometrics on the blockchain.

## WebAuthn

WebAuthn is a specification for a JavaScript API that enables FIDO Authentication in the browser. The architecture resembles **DID Auth Architecture 6** in this paper.

In WebAuthn, a _relying party_ associates a public key with an _identity owner_ during a registration process. In subsequent login processes, the _identity owner_ proves control over that same public key. Different public keys can be used for different _relying parties_ based on an "origin".

**WebAuthn Registration:** `Register(Account, Origin)`
**WebAuthn Registration Response :** `RegisterResponse(PublicKeyCredential, Attestation, Origin)`
**WebAuthn Login:** `Sign(Challenge, Origin)`
**WebAuthn Login Response:** `SignResponse(SignedChallenge, Origin)`

In order to adapt WebAuthn to support DIDs, a _relying party_ should associate DIDs rather than public keys with _identity owners_ (use a "DIDCredential" instead of a "PublicKeyCredential"). During the login process, the _identity owner_ includes their DID in the login response, which the _relying party_ uses to look up the current public key from the DID Document.

**WebAuthn+DID Registration:** `Register(Account, Origin)`
**WebAuthn+DID Registration Response:** `RegisterResponse(DIDCredential, Attestation, Origin)`
**WebAuthn+DID Login:** `Sign(Challenge, Origin)`
**WebAuthn+DID Login Response:** `SignResponse(DID, SignedChallenge, Origin)`

Additional Notes:

 * WebAuthn+DID must ensure that the `publicKey` objects in the DID document correspond to the keys used by the FIDO authenticators.
 * WebAuthn+DID requires no service endpoints in the DID document.
 * Ideally, a different DID should be used for each WebAuthn "origin".

# Security and Privacy Considerations

## Support for multiple DIDs

During a DID Auth interaction, a _relying party_ may request that the _identity owner_'s user agent display a DID selection dialog where the _identity owner_ is able to pick the DID to authenticate with to the _relying party_. The DID Auth challenge and response are then done using that DID.

An _identity owner_'s user agent may also automatically choose (or even dynamically create) different DIDs for each _relying party_. This idea is also known as directed identity. If a different DID is used for each _relying party_, then they are called pairwise-pseudonymous DIDs. This measure is helpful (but not always sufficient) to avoid correlation of the _identity owner_.

## Automatic authentication

Depending on the challenge and response transports, and depending on the user agents, it may be possible to automate some steps in a DID Auth interaction. For example, a DID Auth browser extension can automatically complete a DID Auth interaction to log in to a website using a single click on a button.

## Re-authentication

Even after a DID Auth interaction has been completed, a _relying party_ may require an _identity owner_ to re-authenticate in certain cases, e.g. when a high-value transaction such as transferring money is initiated.

## DID resolution

DID Auth depends on the ability to resolve a DID to its associated DID Document. Therefore all security considerations associated with DID resolution must be taken into account. Among other topics, this includes caching behavior of a DID resolver, as well as metadata about the DID resolution process (e.g. has the DID Document been retrieved via a blockchain full node, or via an untrusted intermediary lookup service).

## Hardware wallet

The DID Auth challenge may be forwarded to a hardware wallet, that upon an _identity owner_'s physical interaction, will create a response and send it back to the _relying party_.

## Single log-out

DID Auth should provide ways to end all sessions and channels that have been established for an authenticated DID. An _identity owner_ should be able to trigger single log-out manually using their user agent. Single log-out should also happen automatically if a DID is revoked, which means that _relying parties_ must monitor authenticated DIDs for revocation.

## DID Auth gateway services

In order to ease adoption of DID Auth, gateway services could be developed that expose the OpenID Connect and/or OAuth2 protocols and perform (parts of) a DID Auth _relying party_. In such cases, the privacy and trust implications of the use of a gateway service must be carefully considered.
